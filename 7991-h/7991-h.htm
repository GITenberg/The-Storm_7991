    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Up to the years of the Crimean War Russia was always a strange, uncouth
      riddle to the European consciousness. It would be an interesting study to
      trace back through the last three centuries the evidence of the historical
      documents that our forefathers have left us when they were brought face to
      face, through missions, embassies, travel, and commerce, with the
      fantastic life, as it seemed to them, led by the Muscovite. But in any
      chance record we may pick up, from the reports of a seventeenth century
      embassy down to the narrative of an early nineteenth century traveller,
      the note always insisted on is that of all the outlandish civilisations,
      queer manners and customs of Europeans, the Russian's were the queerest
      and those standing furthest removed from the other nations'. And this
      sentiment has prevailed to-day, side by side with the better understanding
      we have gained of Russia. Nor can this conception, generally held among
      us, which is a half truth, be removed by personal contact or mere
      objective study; for example, of the innumerable memoirs published on the
      Crimean war, it is rare to find one that gives us any real insight into
      the nature of the Russian. And the conception itself can only be amended
      and enlarged by the study of the Russian mind as it expresses itself in
      its own literature. The mind of the great artist, of whatever race he
      springs, cannot lie. From the works of Thackeray and George Eliot in
      England and Turgenev and Tolstoi in Russia, a critic penetrates into the
      secret places of the national life, where all the clever objective
      pictures of foreign critics must lead him astray. Ostrovsky's drama, "The
      Storm," here translated for the English reader, is a good instance of this
      truth. It is a revelation of the old-fashioned Muscovite life <i>from the
      inside</i>, and Ostrovsky thereby brings us in closer relation to that
      primitive life than was in the power of Tolstoi or Goncharov, or even
      Gogol to bring us. These great writers have given us admirable pictures of
      the people's life as it appeared to them at the angle of the educated
      Westernised Russian mind; but here in "The Storm" is the atmosphere of the
      little Russian town, with its primitive inhabitants, merchants, and
      workpeople, an atmosphere untouched, unadulterated by the <i>ideas</i> of
      any outside European influence. It is the Russia of Peter the Great and
      Catherine's time, the Russian patriarchal family life that has existed for
      hundreds of years through all the towns and villages of Great Russia, that
      lingers indeed to-day in out-of-the-way corners of the Empire, though now
      invaded and much broken up by modern influences. It is, in fact, the very
      Muscovite life that so puzzled our forefathers, and that no doubt will
      seem strange to many English readers. But the special triumph of "The
      Storm" is that although it is a realistic picture of old-fashioned Russian
      patriarchal life, it is one of the deepest and simplest psychological
      analyses of the Russian soul ever made. It is a very deep though a very
      narrow analysis. Katerina, the heroine, to the English will seem weak, and
      crushed through her weakness; but to a Russian she typifies revolt,
      freedom, a refusal to be bound by the cruelty of life. And her attitude,
      despairing though it seems to us, is indeed the revolt of the spirit in a
      land where Tolstoi's doctrine of non-resistance is the logical outcome of
      centuries of serfdom in a people's history. The merchant Dikoy, the bully,
      the soft characterless lover Boris, the idealistic religious Katerina,
      Kuligin the artisan, and Madame Kabanova, the tyrannical mother, all these
      are true national types, true Russians of the changing ages, and the
      counterparts of these people may be met to-day, if the reader takes up
      Tehehov's tales. English people no doubt will find it difficult to believe
      that Madame Kabanova could so have crushed Katerina's life, as Ostrovsky
      depicts. Nothing indeed is so antagonistic to English individualism and
      independence as is the passivity of some of the characters in "The Storm."
      But the English reader's very difficulty in this respect should give him a
      clue to much that has puzzled Europeans, should help him to penetrate into
      the strangeness of Russian political life, the strangeness of her love of
      despotism. Only in the country that produces such types of weakness and
      tyranny is possible the fettering of freedom of thought and act that we
      have in Russia to-day. Ostrovsky's striking analysis of this fatalism in
      the Russian soul will help the reader to understand the unending struggle
      in Russia between the enlightened Europeanised intelligence of the few,
      and the apathy of the vast majority of Russians who are disinclined to
      rebel against the crystallised conditions of their lives. Whatever may be
      strange and puzzling in "The Storm" to the English mind, there is no doubt
      that the Russians hail the picture as essentially true. The violence of
      such characters as Madame Kabanova and Dikoy may be weakened to-day
      everywhere by the gradual undermining of the patriarchal family system now
      in progress throughout Russia, but the picture is in essentials a
      criticism of the national life. On this point the Russian critic
      Dobroliubov, criticising "The Storm," says: "The need for justice, for
      respect for personal rights, this is the cry ... that rises up to the ear
      of every attentive reader. Well, can we deny the wide application of this
      need in Russia? Can we fail to recognise that such a dramatic background
      corresponds with the true condition of Russian society? Take history,
      think of our life, look about you, everywhere you will find justification
      of our words. This is not the place to launch out into historical
      investigation; it is enough to point out that our history up to the most
      recent times has not fostered among us the development of a respect for
      equity, has not created any solid guarantees for personal rights, and has
      left a wide field to arbitrary tyranny and caprice." This criticism of
      Dobroliubov's was written in 1860, the date of the play; but we have only
      to look back at the internal history of Russia for the last thirty years
      to see that it too "has not created any solid guarantees for personal
      rights, and has left a wide field to arbitrary tyranny and caprice." And
      here is Ostrovsky's peculiar merit, that he has in his various dramas
      penetrated deeper than any other of the great Russian authors into one of
      the most fundamental qualities of the Russian nature&mdash;its innate
      tendency to arbitrary power, oppression, despotism. Nobody has drawn so
      powerfully, so truly, so incisively as he, the type of the 'samodour' or
      'bully,' a type that plays a leading part in every strata of Russian life.
      From Turgenev we learn more of the reverse side of the Russian character,
      its lack of will, tendency to weakness, dreaminess and passivity: and it
      is this aspect that the English find it so hard to understand, when they
      compare the characters in the great Russian novels with their own idea of
      Russia's formidable power. The people and the nation do not seem to
      correspond. But the riddle may be read in the coexistence of Russia's
      internal weakness and misery along with her huge force, and the immense
      rôle she fills as a civilising power. In "The Storm" we have all the
      contradictory elements: a life strongly organised, yet weak within;
      strength and passivity, despotism and fatalism side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of "The Storm," Alexander Ostrovsky (born in Moscow 1823, died
      1886), is acknowledged to be the greatest of the Russian dramatists. He
      has been called "a specialist in the natural history of the Russian
      merchant," and his birth, upbringing, family connections and vocations
      gave him exceptional facilities for penetrating into the life of that
      class which he was the first to put into Russian literature. His best
      period was from 1850 to 1860, but all his work received prompt and
      universal recognition from his countrymen. In 1859 Dobroliubov's famous
      article, "The Realm of Darkness," appeared, analysing the contents of all
      Ostrovsky's dramas, and on the publication of "The Storm" in 1860, it was
      followed by another article from the same critic, "A Ray of Light in the
      Realm of Darkness." These articles were practically a brief for the case
      of the Liberals, or party of Progress, against the official and Slavophil
      party. Ostrovsky's dramas in general are marked by intense sombreness,
      biting humour and merciless realism. "The Storm" is the most poetical of
      his works, but all his leading plays still hold the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Storm" will repay a minute examination by all who recognise that in
      England to-day we have a stage without art, truth to life, or national
      significance. There is not a superfluous line in the play: all is drama,
      natural, simple, deep. There is no <i>falsity</i>, no forced situations,
      no sensational effects, none of the shallow or flashy caricatures of daily
      life that our heterogeneous public demands. All the reproach that lives
      for us in the word <i>theatrical</i> is worlds removed from "The Storm."
      The people who like 'farcical comedy' and social melodrama, and 'musical
      sketches' will find "The Storm" deep, forbidding and gloomy. The critic
      will find it an abiding analysis of a people's temperament. The reader
      will find it literature.

    <p>
      A public garden on the steep bank of the Volga; beyond the Volga, a view
      of the country. On the stage two benches and a few bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN (<i>sitting on a bench, looking towards the river</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH and SHAPKIN (<i>walking up and down</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN (<i>singing</i>). "Amidst the level dales, upon a sloping
      hillside,"... (<i>ceases singing</i>) Wonderful, one really must say it's
      wonderful! Kudriash! Do you know, I've looked upon the Volga every day
      these fifty years and I can never get tired of looking upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. How's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's a marvellous view! Lovely! It sets my heart rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. It's not bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's exquisite! And you say "not bad"! You are tired of it, or
      you don't feel the beauty there is in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Come, there's no use talking to you! You're a genuine antique,
      we all know, a chemical genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Mechanical, a self-taught mechanician.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. It's all one.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Silence.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN (<i>pointing away</i>). Look, Kudriash, who's that waving his arms
      about over there?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. There? Oh, that's Dikoy pitching into his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. A queer place to do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. All places are alike to him. He's not afraid of any one! Boris
      Grigoritch is in his clutches now, so he is always bullying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. Yes, you wouldn't find another bully like our worthy Saviol
      Prokofitch in a hurry! He pulls a man up for nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. He is a stiff customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. Old Dame Kabanova's a good hand at that too!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Yes, but she at least does it all under pretence of morality;
      he's like a wild beast broken loose!
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. There's no one to bring him to his senses, so he rages about as
      he likes!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. There are too few lads of my stamp or we'd have broken him of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. Why, what would you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. We'd have given him a good scare.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. How'd you do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Why, four or five of us would have had a few words with him,
      face to face, in some back street, and he'd soon have been as soft as
      silk. And he'd never have let on to a soul about the lesson we'd given
      him; he'd just have walked off and taken care to look behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. I see he'd some reason for wanting to get you sent for a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. He wanted to, right enough, but he didn't do it. No, he won't
      get rid of me; he's an inkling that I'd make him pay too dear for it.
      You're afraid of him, but I know how to talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. Oh, I daresay!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. What do you mean by that? I am reckoned a tough one to deal
      with. Why do you suppose he keeps me on? Because he can't do without me,
      to be sure. Well, then, I've no need to be afraid of him; let him be
      afraid of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. Why, doesn't he swear at you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Swear at me! Of course; he can't breathe without that. But I
      don't give way to him: if he says one word, I say ten; he curses and goes
      off. No, I'm not going to lick the dust for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. What, follow his example! You'd do better to bear it in patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Come, I say, if you're so wise, teach him good manners first and
      then we'll learn! It's a pity his daughters are all children, there's not
      one grown-up girl among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. What if there were?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. I should treat him as he deserves if there were. I'm a devil of
      a fellow among the girls!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Dikoy and Boris advance. Kuligin takes off his hat.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN (<i>to Kudriash</i>). Let us move off; he'll pick a quarrel with
      us, very likely.

      SCENE III
    </h2>
    <p>
      KULIGIN, BORIS, KUDRIASH, and SHAPKIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. What have you to do with him, sir? We can't make it out. What can
      induce you to live with him and put up with his abuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. A poor inducement, Kuligin! I'm not free.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. But how are you not free, allow me to ask you. If you can tell
      us, sir, do.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why not? You knew our grandmother, Anfisa Mihalovna?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. To be sure I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. I should think we did!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. She quarrelled with my father you know because he married into a
      noble family. It was owing to that that my father and mother lived in
      Moscow. My mother used to tell me that she could hardly endure life for
      three days together with my father's relations, it all seemed so rough and
      coarse to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Well it might! you have to be used to it from the first, sir, to
      be able to bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Our parents brought us up well in Moscow, they spared no expense.
      They sent me to the Commercial Academy, and my sister to a boarding
      school, but they both died suddenly of cholera. We were left orphans, my
      sister and I. Then we heard that our grandmother was dead here, and had
      left a will that our uncle was to pay us a fair share of her fortune, when
      we came of age, only upon one condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. And what was that, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. If we showed a proper respect for his authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Then there's no doubt, sir, you'll never see your fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. No, but that's not all, Kuligin! First he finds fault with us to
      his heart's content, and ends none the less with giving us nothing, or
      some tiny dole. And then he'll go making out that it's a great favour, and
      that he ought not to have done even that.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. That's just the way the merchants go on among us. Besides, if
      you were ever so respectful to him, who's to hinder him from saying you're
      disrespectful?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. To be sure. And indeed he sometimes will say: I've children of my
      own, why should I give money away to outsiders? Am I to wrong my own like
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's plain, sir, you're not in luck's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. If it were only me, I wouldn't care! I'd throw it all up and go
      away. But I'm sorry for my sister. He did write for her to come too, but
      mother's relations wouldn't let her, they wrote she wasn't well. It
      frightens me to think what the life here would be for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Of course. The master's no decent manners at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. In what capacity do you live with him, sir; what arrangement has
      he made with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why, none whatever; "you live with me," he says, "and do what
      you're told, and your pay shall be what I give you," that's to say, in a
      year's time he'll settle up with me as he thinks fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. That's just his way. Not one of us dare as much as hint at a
      salary, or he storms till he's black in the face. "How do you know," he'll
      say, "what I have in my mind to do? Do you suppose you can see into my
      heart? Maybe, I shall be so disposed as to give you five thousand." It's
      no use talking to him! Only you may be pretty sure he's never been
      disposed that way in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's a hard case, sir! You must try and get the right side of him
      somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. But the point is, Kuligin, that it's impossible. Why, even his own
      children can never do anything to please him; so it's hardly likely I
      could!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Who could please him, when his whole life's spent in bullying
      people? Especially where money's at stake; no accounts are ever settled
      without storms of abuse. Often people are glad to go short of their due,
      if only he'll let them off quietly. Woe to us if anyone vexes him in the
      morning! He falls foul of everyone all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Every morning my aunt entreats us with tears in her eyes: "Don't
      anger him, friends! Dear boys, don't anger him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. But you can never avoid it! If he goes to the bazaar, it's all
      up! He scolds all the peasants. Even if they ask him less than cost price
      they never get off without abuse. And then he's upset for the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAPKIN. He's a bully&mdash;there's no other word for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. A bully? I should think he is!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. And what's fatal is if some man offends him, whom he daren't be
      rude to. Then all his household have to look out for themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Bless my soul! That was a joke though. Didn't that hussar let
      him have it on the Volga, at the ferry! Oh, a lovely shindy he kicked up
      afterwards, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Ah, and didn't his family suffer for it! Why, for a fortnight after
      we were all hiding away in the attics and cupboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Surely that's not the folk coming back from vespers?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Several persons pass in the background</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Come on, Shapkin, let's get a drink! It's no good stopping here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>They bow and exeunt</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Oh, Kuligin, it's awfully hard here for me who've not been used to
      it. Everyone seems to look with unfriendly eyes at me, as though I were
      not wanted here, as though I were in their way. I don't understand the
      ways here. I know this is truly Russia, my own country, but still I can't
      get used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. And you never will get used to it, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. They're a coarse lot, sir, in our town, a coarse lot! Among the
      working people, sir, you'll find nothing but brutality and squalid
      poverty. And we've no chance, sir, of ever finding our way out of it. For
      by honest labour we can never earn more than a crust of bread. And
      everyone with money, sir, tries all he can to get a poor man under his
      thumb, so as to make more money again out of his working for nothing. Do
      you know the answer your uncle, Saviol Prokofitch, made to the provost?
      The peasants were always coming to the provost with complaints that your
      uncle never paid one of them fairly according to agreement. The provost
      said to him at last: "Look here," says he, "Saviol Prokofitch, you must
      pay the peasants what's fairly owing to them! Every day they come to me
      with some complaint!" Your uncle slapped the provost on the shoulder, and
      says he: "It's not worth while, your Worship, for you and me to waste our
      breath over such petty details! I have to do with numbers of peasants in
      the course of the year; you can understand, if I pay them a paltry
      farthing short, every man of them, it mounts up to thousands, and a
      capital thing too for me!" Think of that, sir! And the way they treat one
      another too, sir! They injure each other's trade all they can, and that
      not so much from self-interest, as from envy. They are always at feud with
      one another. They entertain in their grand mansions drunken attorneys'
      clerks, wretched creatures, sir, that hardly look like human beings. And
      they, for a small tip, will cover sheets of stamped paper with malicious
      quibbling attacks on their neighbours. And then there's a lawsuit
      commences between them, sir, and no end to the worry and fret. They bring
      it before the court here, and go off to the chief town, and there everyone
      in court is on the look-out for them and they clap their hands with glee
      when they see them. Words do not take long, but deeds are not soon done.
      They are dragged from court to court, they are worn out with delays; but
      they are positively delighted at that; it's just that they want. "I've
      lost a lot of money," one will say, "but it's cost him a pretty penny
      too!" I did try to put it all into verse....
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why, do you make verse?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Yes, sir, in the old-fashioned style. I have read Lomonosov and
      Derzhavin. Lomonosov was a deep thinker, an investigator of nature.... And
      he was one of us plain working folk too.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. You should write. That would be interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. How could I, sir! They'd tear me to pieces, they'd skin me alive.
      Even as it is, sir, I have had to pay for my chattering; but I can't help
      it, I love to speak my mind freely. I meant to say something about their
      family life, sir, but we'll talk of that some other time. There's plenty
      to tell about that too.

      MME. KABANOVA. I might believe you, my son, if I hadn't seen with my own
      eyes and heard with my own ears how little reverence parents receive
      nowadays from children! They might at least remember all the sufferings a
      mother has to put up with for her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Mamma, I....
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. If the mother that bore you does at times say a word that
      wounds your pride surely you might put up with it! Hey, what do you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But, mamma, when have I not put up with anything from you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. The mother's old, and foolish, to be sure; you young people
      must not be too exacting with us old fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV (<i>sighs, aside</i>). Oh, merciful Heavens! (<i>To his mother</i>)
      We should never dare think such a thing for a moment, mamma!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. It's out of love that parents are severe with you, out of
      love they scold even&mdash;they're always thinking how to train you in the
      right way. To be sure, that's not in favour nowadays. And children go
      about among folks proclaiming that their mother's a scold, that their
      mother won't let them stir, that she's the plague of their life. And if&mdash;Lord
      save us&mdash;some word of hers doesn't please her daughter-in-law, then
      it's the talk all over the place, that the mother-in-law worries her to
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. You don't mean that anyone talks about you, mamma?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I haven't heard so, my son, I haven't; I don't want to tell
      a lie about it. If I had, indeed, I shouldn't be talking to you like this,
      my dear. (<i>Sighs</i>) Ah, sin is a heavy burden! Sin is never far off!
      Something said goes to the heart, and there, one sins, one gets angry. No,
      my son, say what you like about me, there's no forbidding anyone to talk;
      if they don't dare before one's face, they'll do it behind one's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. May my tongue wither up and...
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Hush, hush, don't swear! It's a sin! I've seen plain enough
      for a long time past that your wife's dearer to you than your mother. Ever
      since you were married, I don't see the same love for me that I did in
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. In what way do you see me changed, mamma?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. In everything, my son! When a mother doesn't see a thing
      with her eyes, her heart's so sensitive she can feel it with her heart. Or
      maybe it's your wife sets you against me, I can't say.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Oh no, mamma! how can you say so, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I look upon you as I would on my own mother, and indeed Tihon
      loves you too.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. You might hold your tongue, I should think, till you're
      asked a question. You've no need to defend him, young madam, I'm not going
      to hurt him, no fear! He's my son too, let me tell you; don't you forget
      it! What do you want to fire up and display your feelings before folks
      for! That we may see you love your husband? We know that, we know that,
      you show off before everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>to herself</i>). A nice place she's pitched on to read us a
      sermon!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. You have no need to say that of me, mamma. I am just the same
      before people, as I am by myself. I make no show of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. And I'd no intention of speaking about you at all, but it
      happened to come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Even so, why need you attack me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. My, what a stuck-up thing she is! Here she's in a huff
      directly!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No one likes to put up with unjust blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I know, I know my words are not to your liking, but that
      can't be helped. I'm not a stranger to you, it makes my heart grieve to
      see you. I've seen for a long time past that you want your own way. Well,
      well, you've only to wait a bit, you'll have it all your own way when I'm
      dead and gone. Then to be sure you can do as you please, there'll be no
      elders then to look after you. And, maybe, you will think of me then.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But we pray God night and day for you, mamma, that God may grant
      you health, and every blessing and success in all you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Come, give over, please. I daresay you did love your
      mother, while you were a bachelor. But you've no thoughts for me now
      you've a young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. The one doesn't hinder the other. A wife is something different,
      but for my mother I have a reverence quite apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Then would you give up your wife rather than your mother?
      No, that I'll never believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But why should I give up either? I love both.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Oh, I daresay, I daresay, you may talk away! I see plain
      enough that I'm a hindrance to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. You must think as you please, it's for you to decide in
      everything. Only I can't comprehend why I was ever born into the world so
      unlucky as not to be able to please you anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. What do you mean by whimpering like a sick child! A pretty
      husband, upon my word! You should just see yourself! Do you suppose your
      wife will fear you after that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Why should she fear me? I'm content, if she loves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Why should she fear you! Why should she fear you! What do
      you mean? Why, you must be crazy! If she doesn't fear you, she's not
      likely to fear me. A pretty state of confusion there would be in the
      house! Why, you're living with her in lawful wedlock, aren't you? Or does
      the law count for nothing to your thinking? If you do harbour such fools'
      notions in your brain, you shouldn't talk so before her anyway, nor before
      your sister, that's a girl still. She'll have to be married too; and if
      she catches up your silly talk it's her husband will thank us afterwards
      for the lessons we've taught her. You see how little sense you've got, and
      yet you want to be independent and live as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But indeed, mamma, I don't want to be independent. How ever could
      I be independent!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. So, to your thinking then, kindness is all that's needed
      with a wife? Mustn't even scold her then, or threaten her?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But, indeed, mamma....
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA (<i>hotly</i>). Wait till she sets up a lover.... Hey! But I
      daresay that's no consequence either, to your thinking? Hey? Come, speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But, mercy on us, mamma....
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA (<i>perfectly coolly</i>). Fool! (<i>Sighs</i>) What's the
      use of talking to a fool! it's simply a sin! (<i>Silence</i>) I'm going
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. We'll come directly too; we'll only take one or two more turns on
      the parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Very well; do as you like, only mind you don't keep me
      waiting! You know I don't like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Oh no, mamma! God forbid!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Mind you don't then!

    <p>
      KABANOV. There, you see how I always catch it from mamma on your account!
      A nice sort of life I lead!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Is it my fault?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. I don't know whose fault it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Is it likely you would know?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. She used to keep on at me, "You must get a wife, you must get a
      wife, I'm longing to see you a married man." And now she worries my life
      out, and gives me no peace&mdash;all on your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Well, it's not her fault! Mother attacks her, and you too. And
      then you say you love your wife. It makes me sick to look at you. (<i>Turns
      away</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Talk away! What am I to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Mind your own business&mdash;hold your tongue, if you can't do
      anything better. Why do you stand there shilly-shallying? I can see by
      your face what's in your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Why, what?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What?&mdash;Why, that you want to go in and have a drink with
      Saviol Prokofitch. Eh? isn't that it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. You've hit it, old girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Come back quickly, Tihon dear, or mamma will be scolding again.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Yes, indeed, you must look sharp, or you'll know what to expect.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

      SCENE VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      KATERINA and VARVARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      KATERINA. So you are sorry for me, Varia?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>looking away</i>). Of course, I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Then you love me, don't you? (<i>Kisses her warmly.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Love you? Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Thank you! you are so sweet, I love you dearly. (<i>Silence</i>)
      Do you know what I'm thinking?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What a pity people can't fly!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I don't know what you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What a pity people can't fly like birds. Do you know I sometimes
      fancy I'm a bird. When one stands on a high hill, one feels a longing to
      fly. One would take a little run, throw up one's arms, and fly away!
      Couldn't we try it now? (<i>Makes as though she would run.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What will you make up next?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>sighs</i>). How I used to love play and frolic! But in your
      house I'm growing old and spiritless.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Do you suppose I don't see it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. How different I used to be! I lived without a care in my heart,
      as free as a bird. Mother adored me, dressed me up like a doll, and never
      forced me to work; I could do just as I liked. Do you know how I passed my
      days as a girl? I'll tell you. I used to get up early; if it was summer I
      used to go to the spring, and bathe, and bring back water with me, and
      water all the flowers in the house, every one of them. Then mother and I
      used to go to church, and all the pilgrim women&mdash;our house was simply
      full of pilgrims and holy women. We used to come back from church, and sit
      down to some work, often embroidery in gold on velvet, while the pilgrim
      women would tell us where they had been, what they had seen, and the
      different ways of living in the world, or else they would sing songs. And
      so the time would pass till dinner. Then the older women lay down for a
      nap, while I would run about in the garden. Then evensong, and in the
      evening, stories and singing again. Ah, those were happy days!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. But it's pretty much the same with us, if you come to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Yes, but here one feels somehow in a cage. And how passionately
      I loved being in church! It was like stepping into Paradise, and I saw no
      one and had no thought of time and did not hear when the service was over.
      It was just as if it were all in one second. Mother used to say that often
      everyone looked at me and wondered what had come over me! And you know, on
      a sunny day, such a column of light streamed down from the golden cupola,
      and a sort of mist moving in the light, like smoke, and at times I seemed
      to see angels flying and singing in that bright light. And sometimes, dear
      girl, I would get up at night&mdash;we had lamps always burning all over
      our house,&mdash;and fall down in some corner and pray till morning. Or I
      would go out into the garden early in the morning, when the sun was just
      rising, fall on my knees and pray and weep, and not know myself what I
      prayed and wept for; and so they would find me sometimes. And what I was
      praying for then, what I besought God for&mdash;I couldn't say. I wanted
      nothing, I had enough of everything. And what dreams I used to have, dear
      Varia, what lovely dreams! Golden temples or gardens of some wonderful
      sort, and voices of unseen spirits singing, and the sweet scent of cypress
      and mountains and trees, not such as we always see, but as they are
      painted in the holy pictures. And sometimes I seemed to be flying, simply
      flying in the air. I dream sometimes now, but not often, and never dreams
      like those.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>after a pause</i>). I shall die soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, I know I shall die. Oh, dear girl, something not good is
      happening with me, something strange. It has never been like this with me
      before. There is something in me so incomprehensible. As though I were
      beginning to live again, or ... I don't know what.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What is the matter with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>taking her hand</i>). I'll tell you, Varia; some dreadful sin
      is coming upon me! I have such a terror in my heart, such terror! As
      though I am standing on the edge of a precipice and someone is pushing me
      in, and I have nothing to cling to.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Clutches her head in her hand.</i>]
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What's wrong with you? You can't be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Yes, I am well.... It would be better if I were ill, it's worse
      as it is. A dream keeps creeping into my mind, and I cannot get away from
      it. I try to think&mdash;I can't collect my thoughts, I try to pray&mdash;but
      I can't get free by prayer. My lips murmur the words but my heart is far
      away; as though the evil one were whispering in my ear, and always of such
      wicked things. And such thoughts rise up within me, that I'm ashamed of
      myself. What is wrong with me? There's some trouble, something before me!
      At night I do not sleep, Varia, a sort of murmur haunts me; someone seems
      speaking so tenderly to me, as it were cooing to me like a dove. And now I
      never dream, Varia, those old dreams, of trees and mountains in Paradise;
      but it's as though someone were clasping me passionately&mdash;so
      passionately and leading me, and I follow him, I follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. But what things I am saying to you, a young girl like you.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>looking about her</i>). You can tell me! I'm worse than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Oh what am I to tell you? I'm ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. You've no need! Tell away.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I am stifling, stifling at home, I should like to run away. And
      the fancy comes to me that if I were my own mistress, I would float down
      the Volga now, in a boat, to the singing of songs, or I would drive right
      away clasped close....
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. But not with your husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. How do you know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. As if I didn't know!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Ah, Varia, there is sin in my heart! Alas, how often I have
      wept, I have done everything I can think of! I can't get free from this
      sin. I can't escape. Varia, it is wicked, it is a fearful sin&mdash;I love
      someone else!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I'm not likely to be hard upon you! I've sins enough of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What am I to do? I'm at the end of my strength, where can I find
      help. I'm so wretched, I shall do something dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Mercy on us! what is coming to you! Come, wait a bit, brother's
      going away to-morrow, we'll think of something; maybe, you'll be able to
      see each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, no, that must not be! What are you saying! God forbid!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why are you frightened?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. If I were once to see and speak with him, I should run away from
      home, I would not go back home for anything in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Oh well, wait a little, and then we shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, no, don't talk to me, I don't want to hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why wear yourself out for nothing? You may die of grieving, do
      you suppose they'll be sorry for you? Come, wait a bit. Why, what's the
      good of making yourself miserable?

      SCENE IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      KATERINA and VARVARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Ah, how she frightened me! I'm trembling all over, as if she
      were foretelling something for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Her curse fall on her own head, the old witch!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What was it she said, eh? what did she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. It was all rubbish. It's silly to listen to her raving. She
      foretells evil like that to everyone. She was a sinner all her life from
      her youth up. You should hear the stories they tell about her. So now
      she's afraid of death. And she must try and frighten others with what she
      dreads herself. Why even the little street boys hide away from her; she
      shakes her stick at them and growls (<i>mimicking</i>) "you'll all burn in
      fire unquenchable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>shrinking</i>). Ah, ah, stop! I can't bear it!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. There's nothing to be frightened of! An old fool....
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I am afraid, terribly afraid! I seem to see her all the while
      before us. [<i>Silence.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>looking round</i>). I say, brother doesn't come, and yonder
      there's a storm coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>in terror</i>). A storm! Let us run home! Make haste!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, are you crazy? How can you show yourself at home without my
      brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, let us go home! Never mind him!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. But why are you so awfully frightened? The storm's a long way off
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. If it's so far off, we'll wait then a little, if you like; but
      really it would be better to go. Yes, we'd better go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. But if anything were to happen, you know, you'd be no safer at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, but still, it's better there, it's quieter; at home one can
      turn to the holy pictures and pray to God!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I didn't know you were so afraid of a thunderstorm. I'm not
      afraid, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Don't talk of not being afraid! Everyone must be afraid. What is
      dreadful is not it's killing you, but that death may overtake you all of a
      sudden, just as you are, with all your sins, with all your erring
      thoughts. I have no fear of death, but when I think that I shall be
      brought all at once before the face of God just as I am here, with you,
      after this talk,&mdash;that's what is awful! What I had in my heart! What
      wickedness! fearful to think of! (<i>Thunder.</i>) Ah!

    <h3>
      A room in the house of the Kabanovs.
    </h3>
    <p>
      GLASHA (<i>packing up clothes in a bundle</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter</i> FEKLUSHA.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Dear girl, always at work! What are you doing, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. I'm getting the master's things ready for his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Is he going away then&mdash;the light of our eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Is he going to be away long, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. No, not long.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Well, God speed him on his way! And say, will the young mistress
      do a wail for his going or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. That I can't say, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. But she does wail at times, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Never heard of her doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Well now, my dear, if there's one thing I love, it's to hear a
      wail well done! (<i>Silence.</i>) And mind you keep a sharp look out, my
      girl, on the beggar woman below, that she don't lay her hands on anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Who's to tell the rights and wrongs of it with you begging
      pilgrims, you all speak ill of one another. Why can't you live and let
      live? I should have thought you wandering women get plenty in our house
      all of you, and yet you must always be quarrelling and nagging at each
      other. Aren't you afraid of such sin?
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. One can't be without sin, my good girl; we live in the world.
      I'll tell you what, my dear; you, simple folk, are tempted of one devil,
      but we pilgrim folk are beset, one with six, another with twelve devils;
      and here we have to struggle against all at once. It's a hard fight, my
      dear, a hard fight!
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Why is it you have such a lot?
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Ah, my good girl, that comes of the hatred the evil one has for
      us, because we lead a life of such holiness. But I can't say, my dear,
      that I'm one to gossip; that's not a sin of mine. One failing I have,
      truly; I know myself what it is. I love dainty eating. Well, well, the
      Lord in His mercy provides according to my weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. And have you travelled far in your wanderings, Feklusha?
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. No, my dear, owing to my weakness, I've never gone far away; but
      many a thing I've heard. They do say, my dear, there are countries where
      there are no Tsars of the true faith, but Sultans rule the lands. In one
      land there is the Sultan Mahnoot the Turk on the throne&mdash;and in
      another the Sultan Mahnoot the Persian. And they rule, my good girl, over
      all men, and whatever they decree it's always unrighteous. And they
      cannot, my dear, judge righteously in any one thing, such is the ban laid
      upon them. We have a just law, but they, my dear, an unjust law.
      Everything that is one way in our land is the very opposite in theirs. And
      all the judges with them, in their countries, are unjust too, so that, do
      you know, my girl, they even write in their petitions: "judge me, unjust
      judge!" And there is a country too where all the men have the heads of
      dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. How do they come to have dogs' heads?
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. For their infidelity. I am going off on my rounds among the
      merchant gentry, my dear, to see if there won't be some alms for poverty.
      Good-bye for the present!
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Good-bye! (<i>Exit Feklusha</i>.) Only fancy that there are lands
      like that! There's no end to the marvels in the world. And here we sit at
      home and know nothing. A good thing it is to be sure, that there are pious
      folk; from time to time one hears what is being done in the light of day;
      if it weren't for them, we should live and die in our foolishness.

      SCENE II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      KATERINA and VARVARA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>to Glasha</i>). Carry the bundles down to the chaise, the
      horses are at the door. (<i>To Katerina</i>) You were married off young,
      and you never had any fun when you were a girl; and so your heart is
      restless still.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Glasha goes out.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. And it always will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I have been like that from my birth up, full of fire! I was only
      six years old, when do you know what I did? They offended me somehow at
      home,&mdash;it was in the evening and quite dark&mdash;I ran away to the
      Volga, and got into a boat, and pushed it off from the bank. They found me
      next morning, ten miles down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Really! And were there any men in love with you, as a girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Of course there were!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Well? And didn't you care for anyone?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, I only laughed at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. And you know, Katia, you don't love Tihon.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Oh, yes, I do! I'm dreadfully sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Oh, no, you don't. If you're sorry for him you don't love him.
      And indeed you've no great reason to, I must own. And it's no good your
      being so close with me! I noticed a long while ago, that you were fond of
      some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>with dismay</i>). How did you notice it?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. How absurd you are! I'm not a baby! Well, I'll tell you the first
      sign I knew by; directly you see him, your whole face is transformed. (<i>Katerina
      drops her eyes.</i>) And that's not all....
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>still looking down</i>). Well, whom then?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, you know, what's the use of telling his name?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, tell it! Tell his name!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Boris Grigoritch.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Yes, yes, Varia! Only mind, Varia, for pity's sake....
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. What nonsense! <i>You'd</i> better mind, and not betray yourself
      in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I can't deceive, I don't know how to conceal anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. But there's no doing without deceit; think where you're living!
      Our whole house rests on it! I wasn't fond of lying either, but I learnt
      the trick, when I had to. I was out walking yesterday, and so I saw him
      and had a few minutes talk with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>after a short silence, looking down</i>). Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. He sent greetings to you. He was sorry, he said, that he never
      meets you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>her head still more bent down</i>). As if we could meet! And
      what would be the use....
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. He is so sad and unhappy....
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Don't speak to me of him, for goodness' sake, don't speak of
      him! I don't want to know him even. I will love my husband: Tisha, my dear
      one, no one shall ever take your place! I did not want to think of him,
      you tempt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. All right, don't think of him; no one compels you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. You have no mercy on me! You say: don't think of him, and you
      mention him yourself! Do you suppose I want to think of him; but what can
      I do, when I can't get him out of my mind? Whatever I try to think, he
      seems always standing before my eyes. And I try to be different, and I
      can't. Do you know, last night, the evil one tempted me again. I was
      almost walking straight out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. You are such a fantastical creature, God bless you! What I think
      is: one should do what one likes, only be sure it's kept dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I don't like that. What good can come of it! I had much better
      bear it as long as I can bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. And when you can't bear it, what will you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What shall I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Yes, what will you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Whatever I long to do, I will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Just try; why they'd torment you to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What do I care! I should go away, and that would be the end of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Where would you go? You are a married woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Ah, Varia, you don't know me! I pray, of course, it may never
      come to that! But if I am too miserable here, they would not keep me by
      any force on earth. I should throw myself out of the window, I should
      drown myself in the Volga. If I will not to live here, then I would not,
      they might cut me to pieces! (<i>Silence.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Do you know what, Katia! When Tihon's gone, let's sleep in the
      garden, in the summerhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Oh, why, Varia?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, isn't it just the same to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I'm timid of sleeping in a place I'm not used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Timid, nonsense! Glasha will be with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Still one feels nervous, somehow! But perhaps I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I wouldn't have asked you, only mamma wouldn't let me alone, and
      I must.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>looking at her</i>). What for?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA.(<i>laughing</i>). We'll tell our fortunes together there.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. You must be joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. To be sure, I am joking; did you think I meant it?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Silence</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Where can Tihon be?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, do you want him?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, I only wondered, he has to start so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. He's sitting locked up with mamma. She's nagging away at him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. What for?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. For nothing at all, teaching him to mind what he's about. He'll
      be a fortnight away out of her sight! Only fancy! She has an uneasy
      inkling all the time that he'll enjoy himself when he's his own master.
      And so she's busy now laying all sorts of injunctions upon him, each more
      imperative than the last, and then she'll take him up to the holy picture
      and make him swear solemnly that he'll do everything exactly and precisely
      according to her bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. And so even when he's free he'll be as good as bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Bound! Oh, will he! As soon as he gets away, he'll start
      drinking, you may be sure. He says nothing now, but all the while he's
      only thinking how to get away as soon as possible.

      KABANOV and KATERINA (<i>she stands as though turned to stone</i>).
    </h3>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Katia! (<i>Silence</i>.) Katia, you're not angry with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>after a protracted silence&mdash;shakes her head</i>). No!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But why are you like this? Come, forgive me!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>still in the same position, slightly shaking her head</i>).
      Peace be with you! (<i>Hiding her face in her hands</i>) She has hurt me!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. If you take everything to heart so, you'll soon fall into a
      decline. Why listen to her! You know she must talk! Well then, let her
      talk, and you let it go in at one ear and out at the other. Come,
      good-bye, Katia!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>falling on her husband's neck</i>). Tisha, don't go away! For
      God's sake, don't go away! Dear one, I implore you!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. I must, Katia. When mamma sends me, how can I not go?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Well, take me with you, do take me!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV (<i>freeing himself from her embrace</i>). But it's impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Oh, why, Tisha, impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Much fun there would be in going with you! You've worried me out
      of my life here between you! No sooner have I a hope of escaping than you
      want to fasten yourself upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Why, can it be that you are tired of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. No, I'm not tired of you; but to get out of this slavery a man
      would run away from the loveliest woman in the world! Just consider for a
      minute; I may not be good for much; but I'm a man anyway; and living all
      my life as you see, one's glad to run away from one's wife even. Why, when
      I think now, that for two whole weeks there'll be no storm hanging over
      me, no fetters on my legs,&mdash;do you suppose I can think of my wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. How can I care for you, when you say things like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Say things? Why, what things am I to say? God knows what it is
      you're afraid of! You won't be alone, you know, you'll be with mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Don't speak of her, don't torture my heart! Ah, how wretched I
      am, how wretched! (<i>Weeps</i>.) Where can I go? Whom can I cling to?
      Merciful Heavens, I am lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Come, be quiet!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>goes up to her husband and draws him to her</i>). Tisha, dear
      one, if you would stay, if you would take me with you, how I would love
      you, how I would cherish you, my dear one!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. I can't make you out, Katia! Often there's no getting a word out
      of you, to say nothing of a kiss, and now you come coaxing up to me of
      your own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Tisha, what are you leaving me to? There'll be trouble when
      you're away! There'll be trouble!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Now, come, I can't, so it's no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Well, here then! Take from me some dreadful vow....
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. What vow?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. A vow that I will not dare while you're away on any ground
      whatever to speak with any outsider, nor see anyone,&mdash;that I will not
      even dare to think of anyone but you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But what's this for?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Set my heart at rest, do this for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But one can never answer for oneself like that, anything may come
      into one's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>falling on her knees</i>). May I never look upon my father
      nor my mother! May I die impenitent, if I...

      MME. KABANOVA. The way young folks behave! It makes one laugh really to
      see them! If they weren't my own, I could laugh till I split. They don't
      know the way to do anything properly. Can't even take leave with decorum.
      A lucky thing it is for them that they have elder folk, who will keep
      their house together as long as they're living. And yet, the silly fools,
      they long to be their own masters, though when they do have their own way,
      they get in a mess directly to the scandal and amusement of all worthy
      folk. One here and there, to be sure, will be sorry for them, but for the
      most part they'll all laugh. No one can help laughing either; they'll
      invite guests, and not know how they should sit, and what's more, as
      likely as not, they leave out some one of their relations. It's simply
      comical. But the old order's passing away. There are some houses one
      doesn't care to go into. If you do cross the threshold, all you can do is
      to spit, and get away as quick as may be. What will happen when the old
      people are dead, how the world will go on, I really can't think. I'm
      thankful anyway, that I shall see nothing of it.

      You make a boast of loving your husband so much; I see now how much your

      learnt to do it. If you can't wail properly, you should wail a little, if
      only for example. It is always more decorous; or else one sees it is all

      is! Fling it away, fling it far away, drop it into the river, that it may
      never be found. It burns the hand like fire. (<i>Musing</i>) This is how
      we women come to ruin. How can anyone be happy in bondage? One may be
      driven to anything. Many a one is glad if she gets the chance; she flings
      herself headlong. But how can they, without thinking, without reflecting!
      Easy is the path that leads to misfortune! And then tears and anguish all
      your life: your bondage is bitterer than ever. (<i>Silence</i>) But bitter
      is a life of bondage, ah, how bitter! Who does not weep in it! Most of
      all, we women. Here am I now! I am fretting away my life, and I see no
      loophole of light and hope before me! And I never shall see it, that's
      certain! It'll be worse as it goes on. And now this wickedness too has
      come upon me. (<i>Muses</i>) If it were not for my mother-in-law! ... She
      is crushing me.... She has made the house hateful to me.... I loathe the
      very walls because of her. (<i>Looks dreamily at the key</i>) Throw it
      away? Of course, I must throw it away. And how came it into my hands? For
      my temptation, for my undoing. (<i>Listens</i>) Ah, someone is coming. How
      my heart is beating! (<i>hides the key in her pocket</i>) No! ... No one!
      ... Why was I so frightened? And I have put away the key.... Well, that's
      a sign it is to be! Fate itself, it seems, wills it! And where is the sin
      if I do look at him just once, from a distance. Even if I speak to him,
      still there's no harm in that! But what I said to Tihon ... why, he would
      not have it himself. And maybe, such a chance will not come again all my
      life long. Then I may well weep to myself&mdash;that there was a chance
      and I had not sense to seize it. But why talk, why cheat myself? If I die
      for it, I must see him. Whom am I trying to deceive.... Throw away the
      key! No, for nothing in the whole world! It is mine now.... Come what may,

    <p>
      The Street. The gates of the Kabanovs' house, a garden seat before the
      gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA and FEKLUSHA (<i>sitting on the bench</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. The end of the world is at hand, ma'am, by every sign and token,
      Marfa Ignatievna, the end of the world is at hand. It's peace and paradise
      still here in your town, but in other towns it's simply Sodom, ma'am: the
      noise, the bustle, the incessant traffic! The people keep running, one one
      way, and one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. We've no need to hurry, my dear, we live without haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. No, ma'am; there is peace and quietness in this town, because
      there are many people, you for instance, adorned with virtues, as with
      flowers; that's why everything is done decorously and tranquilly. Why,
      what is the meaning of all that haste and bustle, ma'am? It is vanity, to
      be sure! In Moscow now: the folk run to and fro; there's no knowing for
      why. It is all vanity. It is a people, full of vanity, ma'am, and so it
      runs to and fro. Each one fancies he's hurrying on business; he hastens,
      poor fellow, doesn't recognise people; it seems to him that someone is
      beckoning him; but when he gets to the place, sure enough it's empty,
      there's nothing there, it's only a dream. And he is downcast and
      disappointed. And another one fancies that he's overtaking someone he
      knows. Anyone looking on can see in a trice that there's no one; but it
      seems to him in his vanity and delusion that he's overtaking someone.
      Vanity, to be sure, is like a fog about them. Here among you on a fine
      evening like this, it's not often anyone even comes out to sit at his
      gate; but in Moscow now there's walking and playing, and a fearful racket
      going on in the street; a continual roar. And what's more, Marfa
      Ignatievna, ma'am, they've harnessed a fiery serpent to drive: all, look
      you, for the sake of more speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I have heard tell of it, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. But I, ma'am, have seen it with my own eyes; no doubt, others,
      in blindness and vanity, see nothing, so it seems a machine to them, but I
      saw it doing like this <i>(spreading out her fingers)</i> with its paws.
      And a roar, too, that folks of righteous life hear for what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. You can call it anything you like, call it a machine, if
      you will; the people is foolish and will believe anything. But as for me
      you might load me with gold, I wouldn't drive with such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. The very idea, ma'am! The Lord preserve us from such a thing.
      And let me tell you too, Marfa Ignatievna, ma'am, a vision I had in
      Moscow. I went out early in the morning, it was just dawn, and on a high,
      very high house, on the roof, I saw someone standing, with a black face.
      You understand whom I mean. And he kept moving his hands, as though he
      were scattering something, but nothing fell. Then I divined that he was
      the enemy sowing tares, and the people in their blindness see it not, and
      gather them up. And that is why they run to and fro so, and the women
      among them are all so thin, and never get plump and comfortable, but
      always look as if they had lost something, or were looking for something,
      and that careworn they are, you feel sorry for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Anything is possible, my dear, in our times, one can't be
      surprised at anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. Hard times they are, Marfa Ignatievna, ma'am, very hard. Already
      the time has begun diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. How is that? diminishing, my dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. We, of course&mdash;how should we observe it in our blindness
      and vanity? but wise people have observed that time has grown shorter with
      us. Once the summer and the winter dragged on endlessly, you got tired of
      looking for the end of them, but now, before one's time to look about one,
      they've flown. The days and the hours still seem the same, of course; but
      the time keeps growing shorter and shorter, for our sins. That's what the
      learned folk say about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. And worse than that will be, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      FEKLUSHA. I only trust we shan't live to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Maybe, we shall. [<i>Enter Dikoy.</i>

    <h3>
      The Same and DIKOY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. What brings you abroad so late, old friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Why, who's to hinder me being out, I should like to know?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Who wants to hinder you, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Well, then what's the use of talking? Whose control am I under,
      hey? What next will you say? What the devil....
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Now then, keep a little check on your tongue! You'd better
      look out for someone else to talk to! I won't let you off so easily as
      some do! Go your way wherever you're going. Come indoors, Feklusha.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Gets up.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Wait a bit, old friend, wait a bit! Don't be angry. You're in no
      hurry to get home; your home's not many miles away. Here it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. If you've come on business, don't shout at me, but speak
      out plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. I've no business, but I'm drunk, that's what it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Well, would you have me praise you for that, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Needn't praise or blame. Only I'm drunk, and that's all about it. I
      can't get over it till I've slept it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Well, go and have a sleep then.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Where am I to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Home, of course, where else?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. But if I don't want to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Why not, allow me to ask you?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Because I've a row going on there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Why, who is there to quarrel with? You're the only
      quarrelsome one there, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Well, what if I am quarrelsome, hey? What of it, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Oh, nothing. Only there's no great glory in doing battle
      all your life with women, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Well, I suppose they ought to obey me! Or am I to obey them, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I really wonder at you; with all the crowd of folks in your
      house, not a single one can do anything to your liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. That's so!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Come, what do you want of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Well, talk me out of my temper. You're the only person in the whole
      town who knows how to talk to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Go in, Feklusha, and order a little something to be served.
      <i>(Feklusha goes.)</i> Let's go indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. No, I'm not going indoors, I'm worse indoors!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. How have they put you into such a rage?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. I've been so all day since the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I suppose they've been asking for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. As if they were in league together, damn them. One after another
      the whole day long they've been at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. No doubt you'll have to give it them, or they wouldn't
      persist.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. I know that; but what would you have me do, since I've a temper
      like that? Why, I know that I must pay, still I can't do it with a good
      will. You're a friend of mine, and I've to pay you something, and you come
      and ask me for it, I'm bound to swear at you! Pay I will, if pay I must,
      but I must swear too. For you've only to hint at money to me, and I feel
      hot all over in a minute; red-hot all over, and that's all about it. And
      to be sure at such times, I'd swear at anyone for nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. You've no one over you, and so you think you can do as you
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. No, you hold your tongue! Listen to me! I'll tell you the sort of
      troubles that happen to me. I had fasted and all ready for sacrament in
      Lent, and then the evil one thrusts a wretched peasant under my nose. He
      had come for money,&mdash;for wood he had supplied us. And for my sins he
      must needs show himself at a time like that! I fell into sin, of course, I
      pitched into him, pitched into him finely, I did, all but thrashed him.
      There you have it, my temper! Afterwards I asked his pardon, bowed down at
      his feet, upon my word I did. It's the truth I'm telling you, I bowed down
      at a peasant's feet. That's what my temper brings me to: on the spot
      there, in the mud I bowed down at his feet; before everyone, I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. But what do you work yourself up into a rage on purpose
      for? That's not right, my friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. On purpose? How d'you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. I've seen you, I know all about it. When you see that
      people are going to ask you for anything, you go and pick a quarrel
      purposely with one of your household, so as to work yourself into a rage.
      For you know that when you're in a rage, no one dare come near you. That's
      a pretty thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Well, what of it? Who likes parting with his property?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Glasha comes in.</i>

      GLASHA. Marfa Ignatievna, lunch is served!

      sent us!

      DIKOY. Much obliged.
    </p>

    <p>
      BORIS. Isn't my uncle inside?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Yes. Do you want him?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. They sent me from home to find out where he was. But since he's
      with you let him stop there; no one wants him. At home they're pleased and
      happy that he's out.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Our good lady out to marry him, she'd soon make him mind what he's
      about. But I mustn't stop here gossiping with you! Good-bye. [<i>Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Ah, merciful Heavens! For one glimpse of her! I can't go into the
      house. No one calls anywhere uninvited in this place. What a life! We are
      living in the same town, almost next door; yet we barely see each other
      once a week, and then only in church, or in the street,&mdash;and that's
      all! When a woman's married here she might as well be buried,&mdash;it's
      all the same. <i>(Silence.)</i> If only I had never seen her; it would
      have been better for me! I can only see her by snatches, and before
      people,&mdash;who are all eyes, staring at one. It's simply heartrending.
      And yet there's no mastering oneself. If I go out for a walk, I always
      find myself here at the gate. And what use is there in coming here?
      There's never any chance of seeing her, and what's more, it may give rise
      to gossip and do her harm. Well, it's a fine town, certainly!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>He is going, Kuligin comes, meeting him.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Well, sir? out for a walk?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes, it's very pleasant out now.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Very pleasant it is, sir, walking now. The stillness, the sweet
      air, the scent of flowers from the far side of the Volga, the clear sky&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The space aloft, filled full of stars, Stars numberless, space limitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we go to the parade, there's not a soul there.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes, come along.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN That's our town all over, sir! Here they've made a parade, but
      they don't walk there. They only walk out on fête days, and then they only
      make a show of being out for a walk. They really come out to show off
      their best clothes. You never meet anyone but maybe a drunken attorney's
      clerk reeling home from the tavern. The poor have no time, sir, to walk
      out; they must work and worry day and night. Three hours' sleep is all
      they get out of the twenty-four. But what are the rich about? You'd wonder
      why they shouldn't walk about and enjoy the fresh air. But not a bit of
      it! They've all had their gates, sir, locked up long ago, and their dogs
      let loose. ... Do you suppose they are at work at their business, or
      praying to God? No, sir! And it's not for fear of thieves they lock
      themselves up; it's that folks shouldn't see the way they ill-treat their
      household, and bully their families. And the tears that flow behind those
      bolts, unseen, unheard of! But there's no need to tell you that, sir! You
      can judge of it for yourself. And the sordid sodden vice within those
      barred gates, sir! And all hidden and buried&mdash;no one sees or knows
      anything of it, God alone beholds it! Stare at me as you like, say they,
      in the street and among folk, but you've nothing to do with my family;
      that's what I have locks for, and bolts and bars and savage dogs. The
      family's something apart, secret! We know all about such secrets!&mdash;secrets,
      sir, that make one man merry, perhaps, while the rest are weeping and
      wailing. Much secrecy about it! Everyone knows! Robbing their orphans,
      kinsfolk, nephews, beating their dependents till they're too cowed to hint
      at what goes on within doors,&mdash;there's no great secret in that! But
      that's enough of them! Do you know, sir, who do go for walks here? The
      young fellows and girls. They steal an hour or two from sleep and walk out
      in couples. There's a couple over there!

      KUDRIASH (<i>stops singing</i>). Hullo! Such a sober, staid person as you,
      out on the spree too?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Kudriash, is that you?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. What are you here for?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. What for? I suppose because I want to be here, Boris Grigoritch,
      since I am here. I shouldn't have come if I hadn't wanted to. Where is
      fortune taking you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS (<i>looking carefully at the scene around him</i>). Look here,
      Kudriash, I've got to stop here, and I've no doubt it's all the same to
      you, so you might go and sit in some other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. No, Boris Grigoritch, you're here, I perceive, for the first
      time, but this is a place where I have often sat, and this little path has
      been trodden by my feet. I like you, sir, and am ready to do you any
      service; but you'll kindly refrain from meeting me in this path at night,
      lest evil come of it. Fair words are better than gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. What is the matter with you, Vania?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Vania, indeed! I know my name's Vania. But you go on your way,
      that's all about it. Find a girl to your liking, and walk out with her to
      your heart's content, and no one will say a word to you. But don't meddle
      with other fellows' girls! That's not the way we do things here, or the
      fellows will break your legs for you. For my girl ... Well, I don't know
      what I wouldn't do! I'd cut your throat!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. You're angry for no reason; I've not the slightest idea of robbing
      you of her. I shouldn't have come here if I hadn't been told to.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Who told you to?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I couldn't make out, it was dark. A girl stopped me in the street
      and said I was to come just here, behind the Kabanovs' garden, where there
      is a little path.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Who could that be?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Listen, Kudriash. Could I speak to you openly, you wouldn't gossip?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. You needn't be afraid of that! I'm as safe as the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I know nothing of your habits and ways of doing things here; but
      the fact is ...

      KUDRIASH. You're in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes, Kudriash.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Oh, well, that's all right. We're free enough in that way. The
      girls amuse themselves as they like, and the father and mother have
      nothing to say to it. It's only the wives are kept shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. That's just what's so sad.

      you'll throw up one and pick up another easily enough! But I can't do like
      that! If once I love ...

      KUDRIASH. That's as much as to say you're ready to ruin the poor thing
      completely, Boris Grigoritch!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. God forbid! God forbid! No, Kudriash, how can you! I ready to ruin
      her! I only want to see her, to speak to her, I ask for nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. You can't answer for yourself like that, sir! And just think
      what sort of people you have to deal with here. You know them yourself.
      They'd be the death of her, they'd torment her into the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Ah, don't say that, Kudriash, please don't frighten me!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. But does she care for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Have you ever met then?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I have only once been in their house with my uncle. And I see her
      in church, and pass her sometimes on the parade. Ah, Kudriash, how she
      prays, if you could see her! the angelic smile on her face! her face seems
      to shed light.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Oh, then it's the young wife of Kabanov.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes, Kudriash.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Oh, so that's it! Well, I humbly congratulate you!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. What for?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Well, things look promising for you, since she's sent you word
      to come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Can it be she sent word?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Why, who else could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. No, you're making fun of me! It can't be so. (<i>Clutches his head</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I shall go mad with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. What next! I can't see anything to go mad about! You look out
      that you don't make a mess of things and get her into trouble! Her
      husband's a fool, we all know, but her mother-in-law is terrible.

    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>comes down the path and, hiding her face in her kerchief, goes
      up to Boris</i>). You wait a bit, lad. You've something to wait for. (<i>To
      Kudriash</i>) Let's go to the Volga.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. Why have you been so long? Kept me waiting again! You know I
      don't like it! (<i>Varvara puts one arm round him and they walk away.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. It's like a dream! This night, and singing and trysts! They're
      walking, their arms round each other. It is so new for me, so sweet! Here
      I am waiting for something. And what I am waiting for&mdash;I know not and
      cannot picture to myself; only my heart is throbbing and every nerve is
      quivering. I cannot think even what to say to her, I can hardly breathe,
      my knees are shaking! My stupid heart is in my mouth, I can't quiet it.
      Here she comes. (<i>Katerina slowly comes down the path, wrapt in a large
      white kerchief, her eyes fixed on the ground. Silence.</i>) Is it you?
      Katerina Petrovna? (<i>Silence.</i>) How can I ever thank you,&mdash;I

    <p>
      [<i>Tries to take her hand.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>with terror, but not raising her eyes</i>). Do not touch me,

    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Do not be angry!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Go away from me, go away, unhappy man! Do you know that never by
      any prayer can I be free of this sin, never again! Like a stone it will
      lie on my soul, like a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Do not send me away!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Why did you come? Why did you come for my undoing? I am a wife,
      you know, I must live with my husband, till I lie in the grave....
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. You told me yourself to come ...
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Till the grave; do you understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Better if I had never seen you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>with great emotion</i>). You see what I am preparing for
      myself? What is the only place left for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Calm yourself. (<i>Takes her hand</i>) Sit down!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Why do you wish for my ruin?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. How can I wish to injure you, when I love you more than anything in
      the world, more than myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, no! You have been the undoing of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Am I such a wicked wretch?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>shaking her head</i>). I am lost, lost, lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. God forbid! I'd rather perish myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Have I not forsaken my home, and come out to you in the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. You came of your own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I have no will. If I had had any will left of my own, I would
      not have come to you. (<i>Lifts her eyes and looks at Boris. A short
      silence</i>.) Your will is upon me now, don't you see that? [<i>Sinks on
      his neck</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS (<i>puts his arms about Katerina</i>). My life!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Ah, if death would come quickly now!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why die when life is so sweet for us?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, life is not for me! I know it is not for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Don't say such things, please, don't torture me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Yes, you are happy, you are free as the air, but I! ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. No one shall know of our love. Do you think I have no feeling for
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Ah! Why feel for me, it's no one's fault. I have come to this of
      myself. Don't think of me! Anyone may know, anyone may see what I do! (<i>Takes
      Boris in her arms</i>.) Since I have not feared to do wrong for you, am I
      likely to fear the judgment of men? They do say, it will be better for
      one, if one has to suffer here on earth for any sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Come, why think of that, when we are happy now!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Why, truly! I shall have long years to weep enough hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. And I was so frightened, I thought you would send me away.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>smiling</i>). Send you away! How could I? Not with my heart.
      If you had not come, think I should have gone to you myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I never even guessed you loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I have loved you for so long. It's as though, for my sins, you
      came here to torment me. Directly I saw you I ceased to belong to myself.
      From the first moment, I believe, if you had beckoned to me, I would have
      followed you; to the ends of the earth I would have followed you, and
      never looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Has your husband gone away for long?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. For a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. O, then we will be happy! that is a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. We will be happy. And then ... (<i>sinks into dreamy musing</i>).
      If they lock me up, that will be my death! And if they don't lock me up, I
      will find some way to see you again! [<i>Enter Kudriash and Varvara</i>.

      The Same, with KUDRIASH and VARVARA.

    <p>
      VARVARA. Well, have you made friends? (<i>Katerina hides her face on
      Boris's breast</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. You might go and walk about a bit and let us rest. When it's time
      to go in, Vania will shout. (<i>Boris and Katerina go away, Kudriash and
      Varvara sit down on the stone</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. This is a first-rate plan, getting out at the garden gate. It's
      fine and convenient for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. It's all my doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. There's no one like you for such things. But what if your mother
      catches you?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Oh! How could she? It would never enter her head!
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. But if by ill luck, it were to?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Her first sleep is sound; in the early morning now, there is more
      chance of her being awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. But there's never any knowing! Some evil spirit might rouse her
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Well, even then! Our gate into the yard is locked on the inside,
      the garden side; she would knock and knock and then go away. And in the
      morning we'd declare we'd been sound asleep and heard nothing. Besides,
      Glasha's on the lookout; the faintest sound, she'd let us know in a
      minute. One can't do anything without some risk! No, indeed! the only
      thing is to mind what one's about and not get into a scrape. (<i>Kudriash
      strikes a few cords on the guitar. Varvara leans on the shoulder of
      Kudriash who plays softly, paying no attention to her. Varvara yawning</i>)
      How could we find out what time it is?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. It's one o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      KUDRIASH. A watchman struck one blow on his board just now.
    </p>

      VARVARA (<i>yawning</i>). It's late. Shout to them! We'll get out earlier
      tomorrow, so as to have longer.

    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>gets up</i>). Well, good-bye! (<i>yawns, then gives a cool

      FIRST (<i>staring round at the walls</i>). I say, old fellow, it must have
      been covered with paintings once, do you know. One can make them out even
      now, here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND. To be sure! Of course the walls were covered with paintings. Now
      it's all been let go to rack and ruin, and the old place is falling to
      pieces. There's been nothing done to it since the fire. But to be sure you
      don't remember that fire, it will be forty years ago.

      FIRST. Whatever's this picture here, old fellow? It's not easy to make out
      what it's about.

      up, for instance, on the parade in the open space. And as for expense,&mdash;the
      expense would be trifling: a stone column (<i>indicates the size of each
      thing by gestures</i>), a copper disc, round like this, and a pivot, an
      upright pivot (<i>shows, gesticulating</i>) of the simplest description. I
      will put it all up and carve the figures on the face myself too. And, your
      worship, when you are pleased to take a walk, or any other people are out
      walking, you will go up to it, and see at once what o'clock it is. As it
      is, it's a fine position and a fine view and all, but, as it were, it
      wants something. And we have visitors too, your worship, who come here to
      see our views, and it will always be an ornament,&mdash;a pleasant object
      for the eye to rest on.

      idiocy? It's possible, don't you see, that I don't want to talk to you.

      not, you dolt. What am I to you? ... am I your equal, eh? Damn the fellow!
      A mighty clever idea he's hit upon! And then up he must come and
      straightway start holding forth upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. If I were about my own business, I should be to blame certainly.
      But I am speaking in the public interest, your worship. And it's no great
      matter spending about a pound on a public object! More than that would not
      be needed, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. I daresay you'd like to pocket the money; who knows anything of
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Seeing that I want to give my services for nothing, your worship,
      how could I pocket anything? And everyone knows me here; no one can say
      any harm of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. They may know you, for all I care, but I don't want to know you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Why insult an honest man, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. Am I to account to you for what I say or do? Let me tell you I
      allow no one to criticise my actions&mdash;no, not folks of far more
      consequence than you. I shall think of you as I choose to think of you.
      Others may say you're an honest man, but I look upon you as a brigand, and
      that's all about it. You seem anxious to hear my opinion, so here it is! I
      say you're a brigand, and nothing else! Do you want to have the law of me,
      hey? Very well then, let me tell you you're a worm. If I choose, I spare
      you; if I choose, I can trample you under foot!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. So be it, Saviol Prokofitch! I am only a poor man, sir, it costs
      little to be rude to me. But let me remind you, your honour, virtue is
      honourable even in rags!
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. None of your insolence now! Mind that!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. I am not being insolent to you in any way, sir, and I merely
      addressed you because I thought you might have a mind to do something for
      the town sometime. You have a great deal of power, your worship, if only
      you had the wish to do some good. Now, for instance, we've storms so
      often, and yet we don't put up lightning conductors.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY (<i>haughtily</i>). It's all vanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. How can it be vanity when experiments have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. What sort of lightning conductors are you talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Steel ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY (<i>wrathfully</i>). Well, and what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Steel rods.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY (<i>getting more and more furious</i>). I hear they're steel rods,
      you viper, but what of it? Granted they're steel rods! Well, what of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. And what is the cause of a storm to your notions, hey? Come, speak
      up!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY (<i>stamping</i>). 'Lectricity he says! Ah, a brigand you are and no
      mistake! a storm is sent as a chastisement to make us feel our sins, and
      you want with rods and tackle of one sort and another, God forgive you, to
      ward it off! What, are you a Tartar or what? Are you a Tartar? Speak up! A
      Tartar, hey?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Saviol Prokofitch, your honour, Derzhavin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      In body, I languish in the dust, In mind, I command the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. For such words you ought to be led off to the police captain, he'd
      give it to you! Just listen, worthy citizens, what the fellow is saying!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. There's no help for it, I must submit! But when I have made my
      fortune, then you'll see how I'll talk!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>With a wave of his hand goes out.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      DIKOY. What! are you going to steal a fortune? Stop him! The false
      scoundrel! How ever is one to treat such people! I don't know. (<i>Turning
      to the crowd</i>) And you, damned rascals, you're enough to make anyone
      swear! Here I'd no wish to lose my temper, and he must needs go and put me
      out, as if it were on purpose. Curse the fellow! (<i>angrily</i>) Has the
      rain given over, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST. I fancy it has.

      SCENE III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      VARVARA and later BORIS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I believe it's he! (<i>Boris advances from the background of the
      scene</i>.) Sss-sss! (<i>Boris looks round</i>.) Come here. (<i>She
      beckons, Boris goes up to her</i>.) What are we to do with Katerina? For
      mercy's sake tell me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. It's terrible, that's all. Her husband has come back, do you know
      that? We didn't expect him, but he's here.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. No, I didn't know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. She's simply beside herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. It seems as if I had only lived for these ten short days that he
      has been away. And now not to see her!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Oh, I've no patience with you! I've something to tell you! She's
      shaking all over, as if she were in a fever. She's so pale, she wanders
      about the house, as though she were looking for something. Her eyes are
      wild, she's like a mad thing! She began crying long ago in the morning,
      she simply sobs. Merciful Heavens, what am I to do with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. But perhaps this will pass off.
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I doubt it. She daren't raise her eyes to her husband. Mamma's
      begun to notice it, and she follows her about and keeps a suspicious eye
      upon her. She looks daggers at her; and that makes her worse than ever. It
      makes one wretched to see her. And I'm afraid too.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. What are you afraid of?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. You don't know her. She's a strange creature. One never knows
      what to expect from her! She will do things ...
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. My God! What's to be done? You must talk to her thoroughly. Can't
      you manage to soothe her?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. I've tried. She doesn't even hear. Better leave her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Well, what do you suppose she may do?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Why, simply this: fling herself down at her husband's feet, and
      tell him everything. That's what I'm afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS (<i>with horror</i>). Could she possibly!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. She may do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Where is she now?
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. At this moment she's out on the parade with her husband, and my
      mother's with them too. You go and meet them, if you like. But no, you'd
      better not go, or she'll very likely lose her head completely. (<i>A peal
      of thunder in the distance</i>) Isn't that thunder? <i>(Looks out)</i>
      Yes, it's raining too. And here are people coming this way. Get somewhere
      out of sight, and I'll stand here where I can be seen, so that they won't
      notice anything. <i>(Enter several persons of both sexes and different
      classes.)</i>

      and KULIGIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST. The good lady seems awfully frightened by the way she's hurrying
      for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A WOMAN. No use seeking shelter! If it's written in the book of fate,
      there's no escaping!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA <i>(running in).</i> Ah, Varvara! <i>(Seizes her hand and holds
      it tight.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Come, be quiet!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. It will be my death!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Come, come! Pull yourself together!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No! I can't. I can do nothing. My heart aches so.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA <i>(entering).</i> Let me tell you, one should live so as to
      be always ready for anything. You would not be in such terror then.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But what sins in special has she to frighten her, mamma? Her sins
      are no more than all of us have to repent; being afraid of storms is a
      matter of temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. How do you know, pray? The heart of another is darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV <i>(jestingly).</i> Oh well, maybe, something very wicked while I
      was away; certainly when I've been here she never did anything bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Maybe, when you were away, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV <i>(jesting).</i> Katia, my girl, you'd better repent, if you've
      been sinful in any way. You can't have secrets from me, you know; no, you
      naughty girl, I know all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA <i>(looks him straight in the face).</i> Dear Tihon!
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA. Come, why do you keep teazing her? Can't you see she's not well?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Boris steps out of the crowd and bows to the Kabanovs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>shrieks</i>). Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. What are you frightened of? Did you think it was a stranger? This
      is a friend! Is your uncle quite well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Quite, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA (<i>to Varvara</i>). What more does he want of me? ... Isn't it
      enough that I am in torture like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Leans against Varvara, sobs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      VARVARA (<i>aloud, so that her mother should hear</i>). We're simply tired
      out, and don't know what to do with her; and now outsiders must come up
      too!
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Gives Boris a sign and he walks away to the entrance of the arcade.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN (coming into the middle of the scene and addressing the crowd).
      Why, what are you afraid of, I should like to know! every blade of grass,
      every flower is rejoicing now, while we try to get away and are as
      frightened as if it were a disaster! The storm kill us indeed! It's not a
      storm to be dreaded, it's a blessing! Yes, a blessing! Everything's
      dreadful to you. If the Northern Lights shine in the heavens&mdash;you
      ought to admire and marvel at "the dawn breaking in the land of midnight!"
      But you are in terror, and imagine it means war or flood. If a comet comes&mdash;I
      can't take my eyes from it! a thing so beautiful! the stars we have looked
      upon to our hearts' content, they are always with us, but that is
      something new; well, one must gaze and admire! But you're afraid even to
      look at the sky, and all in a tremble! You make a bogey out of everything.
      Ah, what a people! I'm not afraid, you see. Come, sir, let's go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Yes, let us go! it's more terrible here! [<i>Goes.</i>

      The Same, without BORIS and KULIGIN.

    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. Well, that's a pretty sermon he gave us! Something worth
      hearing, and no mistake! What have the times come to, when such as he turn
      teacher! If an old man talks so, what can we expect from the young ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      A WOMAN. The whole sky's overcast. It's covered up all over, as it were,
      with a cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST. Eh, mate, see how the storm cloud is rolling into a ball, as though
      there were something alive turning round in it. And see how it's creeping
      up towards us, creeping like a live thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND. Mark my words, that storm's not coming up for nothing. It's the
      truth I tell you; I know. It'll strike someone dead, or set fire to a
      house; you'll see, look what an extraordinary colour!

      KATERINA <i>(listening).</i> What are they saying? They say someone will

      heads.

      what a beauty! Ha, ha, ha! Beauty! Better pray to God to take away your
      beauty! It's beauty that is our ruin! Ruin to yourself, a snare to others,
      so rejoice in your beauty if you will! Many, many, you lead into sin!
      Giddy fellows fight duels over you, slash each other with swords for your
      sake. And you are glad! Old men, honourable men, forget that they must
      die, tempted by beauty! And who has to answer for all. Better go down into
      the abyss with your beauty! Yes, quick, quick. <i>(Katerina hides
      herself.)</i> Where will you hide away, foolish one! There's no escaping
      God! <i>(A clap of thunder.)</i> All of you will burn in fire

      My heart is torn! I can bear it no longer! Mother! Tihon! I have sinned
      against God and against you! Did I not swear to you I would not set eyes
      on anyone when you were away! You remember! you remember! And do you know

      oh, such a sermon, but as soon as I was well away, I went in for enjoying
      myself. I was glad to have escaped into freedom. And I was drinking all
      the journey, and in Moscow too I kept it up, and had a jolly time&mdash;as
      you may fancy! Of course I'd to get in fun enough to last me the whole
      year. I never once thought about home. Though, if I had thought of it, I
      never should have dreamed of what was going on here. You've heard about
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. I'm a miserable man now! And so, for nothing, my life's spoiled,
      for nothing I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Your mother is terribly hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Yes, indeed, she's the cause of it all. And what am I suffering
      for, tell me that? Here I've just come from Dikoy's, and well, we drank a
      bit; I thought it would drown care; but it has only made me worse,
      Kuligin! Ah, the wrong my wife has done me! It couldn't be worse....
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's a difficult business, sir. It's difficult to judge between
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. No; nothing could be worse than what she's done! It wouldn't be
      much to kill her for it. There's mamma keeps saying: she ought to be
      buried alive to punish her! But I love her, I can't bear to lay a finger
      on her. I did give her a blow or two, but that was at mamma's bidding. It
      makes one wretched to see her, do you understand that, Kuligin. Mamma's
      just tormenting her to death, while she wanders about like a shadow, and
      makes no resistance. She only weeps, and she's wasting away like wax. It's
      simply breaking my heart to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. You must make it up somehow, sir! You ought to forgive her, and
      never refer to it again. You are not without sin yourself, I daresay!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. I should think not!
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. And you must never reproach her even when you're drunk! She would
      be a good wife to you yet, sir, better than any&mdash;believe me.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. But understand me, Kuligin; I'd never say a word, but mamma ...
      do you suppose one can get over her!...
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. It's time you were guided, sir, by your own good sense, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. My own good sense! I've got none, I'm told, and so I'm to live by
      other people's! I declare I'll drink away whatever sense I have left, and
      then mamma can look after me as much as she likes, when I'm crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Ah sir! there's a world of troubles! But, Boris Grigoritch, sir,
      what of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Oh, he, the scoundrel, is being sent off to Tiahta, to the
      Chinese. His uncle's sending him off to a merchant he knows there. He's to
      be there three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Well, what does he say to it, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Oh, he's wretched too; he weeps. His uncle and I, we set upon him
      not long ago, we swore at him&mdash;he didn't say a word. He seems like a
      wild thing. Do what you like to me, says he, only don't torment her! He's
      sorry for her too.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. He's a good fellow, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. He's packed up and ready, and the horses are ordered. He's so
      wretched, it's awful! I can see he wants to say good-bye to her. But
      that's too much! I can't have it. He's been an enemy to me, you know,
      Kuligin! He ought to be thrashed within an inch of his life to teach him
      ...
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. We must forgive our enemies, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. You go and tell that to mamma, and see what she'll say to it. So,
      brother Kuligin, all our family is now split up and divided. We're not
      like relations but enemies to one another. Mamma kept nagging and nagging
      at Varvara; she couldn't stand it, and she soon made an end of it&mdash;she's
      simply gone away.
    </p>
    <p>
      KULIGIN. Where has she gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. No one knows. They do say she's run off with Vania Kudriash, and
      he can't be found anywhere either. It's all mamma's doing. I'll tell you
      frankly, Kuligin: she had started bullying her and locking her up. "Don't
      shut me up," she said, "or it will be the worse," and so it has turned
      out. What am I to do, tell me that! Tell me how I am to live now! My home
      is made loathsome to me, I'm put to shame before everyone, if I set about
      anything my hands drop listless and dejected. Here I'm on my way home now.
      Shall I find any happiness there, do you suppose? [<i>Enter Glasha.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Master, Tihon Ivanitch!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. What is it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. There's something wrong at home, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Mercy on us! It's one thing on top of another! Tell me, what is
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. Why, your good lady....
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Well, what? Is she dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. No, sir, she has disappeared; we can't find her anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Kuligin! we must run and search for her. Do you know what I am
      afraid of? That she may be driven in her misery to lay hands on herself!
      She grieves and grieves,&mdash;ah, God! It rends my heart to see her. What
      were you thinking of? Has she been gone long?
    </p>
    <p>
      GLASHA. No, sir, not long! It's we're to blame, of course; we didn't keep
      an eye on her every minute. Though it's true, to be sure, the most
      watchful will be caught napping sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Well, don't stand there doing nothing; bestir yourself! <i>(Exit

    </h3>
    <p>
      [<i>Throughout the whole monologue and in the following scenes she speaks
      slowly and disconnectedly, repeating words dreamily and, as it were, in a
      state of forgetfulness.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, no, nowhere! What is he doing, my poor boy, now? All I want
      is to say good-bye to him, and then ... and then death. Why did I lead him
      into trouble. It's made it no better for me! I should have suffered alone!
      But I have ruined myself, ruined him, brought dishonour on myself,&mdash;everlasting
      disgrace on him&mdash;yes,&mdash;dishonour on myself, and on him
      everlasting disgrace. (<i>Silence</i>.) If I could remember what it was he
      said. How he felt for me? What were the words he said? (<i>Clutches at her
      head</i>) I can't remember, I have forgotten everything. The nights, oh,
      the nights are a weariness to me! All lie down to sleep, I too lie down;
      it is well with all of them, but I lie as in my grave. It is fearful in
      the darkness! There is a sound of singing as at some burial; but so soft,
      almost out of hearing, far away, far from me.... How one longs for the
      light! But I can't bear to get up&mdash;the same people again, the same
      talk, the same torture. Why do they look at me so? Why is it they don't
      kill one nowadays? Why don't they? In old days, they say, they used to
      kill women. If they would take me and throw me into the Volga, I would be
      glad. "If we kill you," they say, "your sin is taken from you; you must
      live, and suffer for your sin." But I have suffered for it already! Am I
      to suffer much longer? What have I to live for now, what for? I care for
      nothing, nothing is sweet to me, the light of day is not sweet to me! And
      still death does not come. One calls upon death and death comes not.
      Whatever I look upon, whatever I hear, it is nothing but aching here <i>(touching
      her heart).</i> If I could be with him, there might perhaps be still some
      joy for me.... Nay, it's all the same, my soul is lost now. How sick I am
      with longing for him! If I cannot see thee, hear me at least from far
      away! Wild winds, bear my grief and longing to him! My God! I am weary, I
      am weary! <i>(goes to the river bank and cries loudly at the top of her
      voice)</i> My sweet, my heart, my soul, I love you! Answer! [<i>Falls

    <h3>
      KATERINA and BORIS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      BORIS (<i>not seeing Katerina</i>). My God! It's her voice! Where is she?
      <i>(Looks round.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA <i>(runs to him and falls on his neck).</i> At last I see you
      again! <i>(Weeps on his bosom. Silence.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. We are weeping together, God has brought us together.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. You have not forgotten me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Me forget you? Don't!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Oh no, oh no! You're not angry?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. How could I be angry?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Forgive me, anyway! I did not mean to harm you; but I was not
      free myself. I did not know what I was doing, what I was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Oh don't! how can you! how can you!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Well, how is it with you? how are you now?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I am going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Where are you going?
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Far away, Katia, to Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Take me with you, away from here!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. I cannot, Katia. I am not going of my own free will; my uncle is
      sending me, he has the horses waiting for me already; I only begged for a
      minute, I wanted to take a last farewell of the spot where we used to see
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Go and God be with you! Don't grieve over me. At first your
      heart will be heavy perhaps, poor boy, and then you will begin to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Why talk of me! I am free at least; how about you? what of your
      husband's mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. She tortures me, she locks me up. She tells everyone and tells
      my husband: "don't trust her, she's sly and deceitful." They all follow me
      about all day long and laugh at me before my face. At every word they
      reproach me with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. And your husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. One minute he's kind, one minute he's angry, but he's drinking
      all the while. He is loathsome to me, loathsome; his kindness is worse
      than his blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. You are wretched, Katia?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. So wretched, so wretched, that it were better to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Who could have dreamed that we should have to suffer such anguish
      for our love! I'd better have run away then!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. It was an evil day for me when I saw you. Joy I have known
      little of, but of sorrow, of sorrow, how much! And how much is still
      before me! But why think of what is to be! I am seeing you now, that they
      cannot take away from me; and I care for nothing more. All I wanted was to
      see you. Now my heart is much easier; as though a load had been taken off
      me. I kept thinking you were angry with me, that you were cursing me....
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. How can you! How can you!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, that's not what I mean; that's not what I wanted to say! I
      was sick with longing for you, that's it; and now, I have seen you....
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. They must not come upon us here!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Stay a minute! Stay a minute! Something I meant to say to you!
      I've forgotten! Something I had to say! Everything is in confusion in my
      head, I can remember nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. It's time I went, Katia!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Wait a minute, a minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Come, what did you want to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. I will tell you directly. <i>(Thinking a moment.)</i> Yes! As
      you travel along the highroads, do not miss over one beggar, give to
      everyone, and bid them pray for my sinful soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS. Ah, if these people knew what it is to me to part from you! My God!
      God grant they may one day know such bitterness as I know now. Farewell,
      Katia! <i>(embraces her and tries to go away).</i> Miscreants! monsters!
      Ah, if I were strong!
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. Stay, stay! Let me look at you for the last time <i>(gazes into
      his face).</i> Now all's over with me. The end is come for me. Now, God be
      with thee. Go, go quickly!
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS <i>(moves away a few steps and stands still).</i> Katia, I feel a
      dread of something! You have something fearful in your mind? I shall be in
      torture as I go, thinking of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KATERINA. No, no! Go in God's name! (<i>Boris is about to go up to her.</i>)
      No, no, enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      BORIS (<i>sobbing</i>). God be with thee! There's only one thing to pray
      God for, that she may soon be dead, that she may not be tortured long!
      Farewell!

      MME. KABANOVA. I'm not going to let you go, and don't you suppose it! Kill
      yourself on her account; she's worth that, isn't she? As if she'd not
      brought disgrace enough on us already, to plot to do a thing like this
      too!
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Let me go!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. There are plenty to help without you. I'll curse you if you
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV <i>(falling on his knees).</i> Oh, to look upon her at least!
    </p>
    <p>
      MME. KABANOVA. They'll pull her out&mdash;you'll look upon her, right
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV (<i>gets up. To the crowd</i>). Well, my lads, do you see
      anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THE CROWD. It's dark down below, there's nothing in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>A noise behind the scene.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A SECOND. They seemed to be shouting something, but I couldn't make out
      what.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST. That's Kuligin's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SECOND. They're coming along the bank with torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE FIRST. They're coming this way, and they're carrying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Several people come back.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME BACK. That Kuligin's a brave fellow! It was
      close here in a deep pool, near the bank; with the torchlight we could see
      a long way off in the water; he saw her dress and pulled her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      KABANOV. Alive?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN. How could she be alive? She had thrown herself from the height;
      the bank is steep there, and she must have fallen upon the anchor, she was
      so injured, poor thing! But she looks as though she were alive! Only one
      little wound on the temple, and one single stain of blood on it.
    </p>

      in Katerina.</i>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
